Herbivorous insects that have similar means of exploiting plant parts for food can be classified into feeding guilds or functional groups. Groups of plant-feeders include grazers that chew foliage, stems, flowers, pollen, seeds and roots, miners and borers that feed between plant surfaces, gall-formers that reside and feed within the plant and induce the production of abnormal growth reactions by plant tissues, sap-suckers that siphon plant fluids, and seed predators and frugivores that consume the reproductive parts of plants (Romoser and Stoffalano 1998). Some species, such as seed predators, seedling-eaters, and tree-killing bark beetles, are true plant predators, but most herbivores function as plant parasites because they normally do not kill their hosts, but instead feed on the living plant without causing death (Price 1980). These different modes of consumption affect plants in different ways. For example, folivores (species that chew foliage) directly reduce the area of photosynthetic tissue, whereas sap-sucking insects affect the flow of fluids and nutrients within the plant, and root-feeders reduce plant capacity to acquire nutrients or remain upright.

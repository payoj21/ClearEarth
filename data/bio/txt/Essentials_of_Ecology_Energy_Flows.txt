The chemical energy stored as nutrients in the bodies and wastes of organisms flows through ecosystems from one trophic (feeding) level to another. For example, a plant uses solar energy to store chemical energy in a leaf. A caterpillar eats the leaf, a robin eats the caterpillar, and a hawk eats the robin. Decomposers and detritus feeders consume the leaf, caterpillar, robin, and hawk after they die and return their nutrients to the soil for reuse by producers.

A sequence of organisms, each of which serves as a source of food or energy for the next, is called a food chain. It determines how chemical energy and nutrients move from one organism to another through the trophic levels in an ecosystem—primarily through photosynthesis, feeding, and decomposition—as shown in Figure 3-13. Every use and transfer of energy by organisms involves a loss of some useful energy to the environment as heat. Thus, eventually an ecosystem and the biosphere would run out of energy if they were not powered by a continuous inflow of energy from an outside source, ultimately the sun.

In natural ecosystems, most consumers feed on more than one type of organism, and most organisms are eaten or decomposed by more than one type of consumer. Because of this, organisms in most ecosystems form a complex network of interconnected food chains called a food web (Figure 3-14). Trophic levels can be assigned in food webs just as in food chains. Food chains and webs show how producers, consumers, and decomposers are connected to one another as energy flows through trophic levels in an ecosystem.

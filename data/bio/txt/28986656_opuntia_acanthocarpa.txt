Opuntia acanthocarpa commonly germinates and grows under the canopy of nurse plants. Hilaria rigida is the most common nurse plant for this and other cholla cacti but this species will utilize other favorable microhabitat. As the cactus develops it often begins to compete with the nurse plant for resources and is often responsible for die backs in the nurse plant. Mature plants can reciprocally play a nurse plant role for other species.

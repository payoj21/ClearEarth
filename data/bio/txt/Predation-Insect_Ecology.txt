Predation has been defined either as a general process of feeding on other (prey) organisms (e.g., May 1981) or as a more specific process of killing and consuming prey (e.g., Price 1997). Parasitism (and the related parasitoidism), the consumption of tissues in a living host, may or may not be included (e.g., Price 1997). Both predation and parasitism are generally considered to have positive effects for the predator or parasite, but negative effects for the prey. Although typically considered in the sense of an animal killing and eating other animals (Fig. 8.4), predation applies equally well to carnivorous plants that kill and consume insect prey, and to herbivores that kill and consume plant prey, especially those that feed on seeds and seedlings. Predator–prey and herbivore–plant interactions represent similar foraging strategies, and they are affected by similar factors (prey density and defensive strategy, predator ability to detect and orient toward various cues, etc.; see Chapter 3).

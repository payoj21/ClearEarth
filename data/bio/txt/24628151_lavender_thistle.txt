Regeneration of lavender thistle after fire is not described in the available literature. However, it probably can colonize burned areas via seeds.Fire frequency in the communities where lavender thistle occurs is generally low. In creosote bush scrub communities, fires generally occur only in years when exceptionally heavy winter rains have produced abnormally high numbers of annuals. Fires are also rare in blackbrush communities; however, these communities have been known to burn under conditions of high temperature, high wind velocity, and low relative humidity. Shad scale communities rarely burn. Pinyon-juniper communities historically burned every 10 to 30 years. Where livestock grazing has reduced grass cover and accelerated erosion, fire frequency has decreased.

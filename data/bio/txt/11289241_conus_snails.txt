Conus snails are among the major predators in tropical reef communities and have adapted to nearly every type of tropical marine habitat. Although most Conus species prey on only a few (or even a single) species, collectively, they feed on at least four or five different phyla. One group of species feeds only on other mollusks; several hundred other species kill and eat marine worms (mainly polychaetes, but also echiuroids and hemichordates). The 50 or so species that are specialized on killing and eating fishes (first described by A.J. Kohn) are the only snails known to kill and eat vertebrates. Conus californicus is unusual in that it has a very broad diet, as well as a temperate distribution.

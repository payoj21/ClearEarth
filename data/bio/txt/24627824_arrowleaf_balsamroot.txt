Arrowleaf balsamroot is a common component in sagebrush communities. Wright and others state where arrowleaf balsamroot and lupine (Lupinus spp.) make up a large component of herbaceous yield in threetip sagebrush communities, fall burning would help maintain the forb component. They classify arrowleaf balsamroot as a cold desert forb and list it as "undamaged" by fall burning. In a Nevada sagebrush-bunchgrass community, where moisture was "adequate" arrowleaf balsamroot responded " well" to spring burning. Where the grass and forb understory was depleted, cheatgrass became the dominant grass.

Boxelder usually develops a shallow, fibrous root system. On deep soils it may form a short taproot with strong laterals (11). 

Reaction to Competition

In the area of its best development, the lower Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, boxelder usually follows the pioneer species of cottonwood and willow in colonizing new ground in alluvial bottoms. In some instances it is a pioneer species in the invasion of old fields (16). Boxelder may persist into the oak-hickory type but then begins to be eliminated, probably due to shading (18). The species is generally classed as tolerant of shade, although less so than the other soft maples (13).

You X X O
understand X X O
the X X O
concept X X O
of X X O
low X X Trait-B

intuitively X X O
when X X O
you X X O
avoid X X O

barefoot X X O
on X X O

on X X O
a X X O

. X X O

Blacktop X X O
has X X O
a X X O
much X X Function-B
lower X X Function-I
albedo X X Trait-B
than X X O
concrete X X O
because X X O
the X X O
black X X Trait-B
surface X X Area-B
absorbs X X Eventuality-B
more X X Function-B
energy X X Eventuality-B
and X X O
reflects X X Eventuality-B
very X X Function-B
little X X Function-I

. X X O

Sea X X Ice_source-B
ice X X Ice_source-I
has X X O
a X X O
much X X Function-B
higher X X Function-I
albedo X X Trait-B
compared X X O
to X X O
other X X O
earth X X Location-B

, X X O
such X X O
as X X O
the X X O

A X X O
typical X X Function-B
ocean X X Area-B
albedo X X Trait-B
is X X O
approximately X X Function-B
0.06 X X Value-B
, X X O
while X X O
bare X X Trait-B
sea X X Ice_source-B

varies X X Eventuality-B
from X X O
approximately X X Function-B
0.5 X X Value-B
to X X O
0.7 X X Value-B
. X X O

This X X O
means X X O
that X X O
the X X O
ocean X X Area-B
reflects X X Eventuality-B
only X X Function-B
6 X X Value-B
percent X X Unit-B
of X X O
the X X O

solar X X Eventuality-B
radiation X X Eventuality-I
and X X O
absorbs X X Eventuality-B
the X X O

, X X O
while X X O
sea X X Ice_source-B

reflects X X Eventuality-B
50 X X Value-B
to X X O
70 X X Value-B
percent X X Unit-B
of X X O
the X X O
incoming X X Eventuality-B

. X X O

The X X O
sea X X Ice_source-B
ice X X Ice_source-I
absorbs X X Eventuality-B
less X X Function-B
solar X X Eventuality-B
energy X X Eventuality-I
and X X O
keeps X X Eventuality-B
the X X O

Snow X X Snow-B
has X X O
an X X O
even X X Function-B
higher X X Function-I
albedo X X Trait-B
than X X O
sea X X Ice_source-B
ice X X Ice_source-I
, X X O
and X X O
so X X O
thick X X Trait-B
sea X X Ice_source-B
ice X X Ice_source-I
covered X X Eventuality-B
with X X O
snow X X Snow-B
reflects X X Eventuality-B
as X X Ice_form-B
much X X Ice_form-I
as X X Ice_form-I
90 X X Value-B

This X X O
serves X X O
to X X O
insulate X X Eventuality-B
the X X O
sea X X Ice_source-B

, X X O
maintaining X X Eventuality-B

After X X O
the X X O

does X X O
begin X X O
to X X O
melt X X Eventuality-B
, X X O
and X X O
because X X O

ponds X X Melting_stage-I
have X X O
an X X O
albedo X X Trait-B
of X X O
approximately X X Function-B
0.2 X X Value-B
to X X O
0.4 X X Value-B
, X X O
the X X O
surface X X Area-B
albedo X X Trait-B
drops X X Eventuality-B
to X X O
about X X Function-B
0.75 X X Value-B
. X X O

As X X O
melt X X Melting_stage-B
ponds X X Melting_stage-I
grow X X Eventuality-B
and X X O
deepen X X Eventuality-B
, X X O
the X X O
surface X X Area-B
albedo X X Trait-B
can X X O

to X X O
0.15 X X Value-B

As X X O

Ice and AIS: ship speed data and sea ice forecasts in the Baltic Sea

The Baltic Sea is a seasonally ice-covered marginal sea located ina densely populated area in northern Europe. Severe sea iceconditions have the potential to hinder the intense ship trafficconsiderably.Thus, sea ice fore- and nowcasts are regularlyprovided by the national weather services. Typically, the forecast comprises several ice propertiesthat are distributed as prognostic variables, but their actual usefulness is difficultto measure, and the ship captains must determine their relativeimportance and relevance for optimal ship speed and safety ad hoc.The present study provides a more objective approach by comparingthe ship speeds, obtained by the automatic identification system(AIS), with the respective forecasted ice conditions. We find that,despite an unavoidable random component, this information is usefulto constrain and rate fore- and nowcasts. More precisely,62â€“67% of ship speed variations can be explained by theforecasted ice properties when fitting a mixed-effect model.Thisstatistical fit is based on a test region in the Bothnian Sea duringthe severe winter 2011 and employs 15 to 25 min averages of shipspeed.

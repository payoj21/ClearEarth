Sea-Ice Indicators of Polar Bear Habitat

Abstract.Nineteen distinct subpopulations of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are found throughout the Arctic, and in all regions they depend on sea ice as a platform for traveling, hunting, and breeding.Therefore polar bear phenology &ndash; the cycle of biological events &ndash; is tied to the timing of sea-ice retreat in spring and advance in fall.We analyzed the dates of sea-ice retreat and advance in all 19 polar bear subpopulation regions from 1979 to 2014, using daily sea-ice concentration data from satellite passive microwave instruments.We define the dates of sea-ice retreat and advance in a region as the dates when the area of sea ice drops below a certain threshold (retreat) on its way to the summer minimum, or rises above the threshold (advance) on its way to the winter maximum.The threshold is chosen to be halfway between the historical (1979&ndash;2014) mean September and mean March sea-ice areas.In all 19 regions there is a trend toward earlier sea-ice retreat and later sea-ice advance.Trends generally range from −3 to −9 days decade−1 in spring, and from +3 to +9 days decade−1 in fall, with larger trends in the Barents Sea and central Arctic Basin.The trends are not sensitive to the threshold.We also calculated the number of days per year that the sea-ice area exceeded the threshold (termed ice-covered days), and the average sea-ice concentration from 1 June through 31 October.The number of ice-covered days is declining in all regions at the rate of −7 to −19 days decade−1, with larger trends in the Barents Sea and central Arctic Basin.The June&ndash;October sea-ice concentration is declining in all regions at rates ranging from −1 to −9 percent decade−1.These sea-ice metrics (or indicators of change in marine mammal habitat) were designed to be useful for management agencies.We recommend that the National Climate Assessment include the timing of sea-ice retreat and advance in future reports.

On producing sea ice deformation data sets from SAR-derived sea ice motion

We propose a method to reduce the error generated when computing sea ice deformationfields from synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-derived sea ice motion. The method is based on twosteps. The first step consists of using a triangulation of thepositions taken from the sea ice trajectories to define a mesh onwhich a first estimate of sea ice deformation is computed. The secondstep consists of applying a specific smoother to the deformation fieldto reduce the artificial noise that arises along discontinuities inthe sea ice motion field. This method is here applied to RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS) sea ice trajectorieshaving a temporal and spatial resolution of about 3 daysand 10 km, respectively.From the comparison between unfiltered andfiltered fields, we estimate that the artificial noise causes anoverestimation of about 60% of opening and closing. Theartificial noise also has a strong impact on the statisticaldistribution of the deformation and on the scaling exponents estimatedwith multifractal analysis. We also show that a similar noise is present in the deformationfields provided in the widely used four-point deformation RGPS data set.These findings may have seriousimplications for previous studies as the constant overestimation ofthe opening and closing could lead to a large overestimation offreezing in leads, salt rejection and sea ice ridging.

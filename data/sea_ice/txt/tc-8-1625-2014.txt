The effect of snow/sea ice type on the response of albedo and light penetration depth (<i>e</i>-folding depth) to increasing black carbon

The optical properties of snow/sea ice vary with age and by theprocesses they were formed, giving characteristic types of snow andsea ice. The response of albedo and light penetration depth(e-folding depth) to increasing mass ratio of black carbon is shown todepend on the snow and sea ice type and the thickness of the snow orsea ice. The response of albedo and e-folding depth of threedifferent types of snow (cold polar snow, wind-packed snow andmelting snow) and three sea ice (multi-year ice, first-year ice andmelting sea ice) to increasing mass ratio of black carbon is calculated usinga coupled atmosphere–snow/sea ice radiative-transfer model(TUV-snow), over the optical wavelengths of 300–800 nm.The snow and sea ice types are effectively defined by a scatteringcross-section, density and asymmetry parameter. The relative change in albedoand e-folding depth of each of the three snow and three sea ice typeswith increasing mass ratio of black carbon is considered relative to a basecase of 1 ng g−1 of black carbon. The relative response of each snow andsea ice type is intercompared to examine how different types of snow and seaice respond relative to each other. The relative change in albedo of a meltingsnowpack is a factor of four more responsive toadditions of black carbon compared to cold polar snow over a blackcarbon increase from 1 to 50 ng g−1, while the relativechange in albedo of a melting sea ice is a factor of two moreresponsive to additions of black carbon compared to multi-year icefor the same increase in mass ratio of black carbon. The response ofe-folding depth is effectively not dependent on snow/sea ice type. Thealbedo of sea ice is more responsive to increasing mass ratios ofblack carbon than snow.

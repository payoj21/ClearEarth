The EUMETSAT sea ice climate record

An Arctic and Antarctic sea ice area and extent dataset has been generated by EUMETSAT's Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) using the record of American microwave radiometer data from Nimbus 7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave radiometer (SMMR) and the Defense Meteorological satellite Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager and Sounder (SSMIS) satellite sensors. The dataset covers the period from 1978 to 2014 and updates and further developments are planned for the next phase of the project. The methodology is using: 1) numerical weather prediction (NWP) input to a radiative transfer model (RTM) for correction of the brightness temperatures for reduction of atmospheric noise, 2) dynamical algorithm tie-points to mitigate trends in residual atmospheric, sea ice and water emission characteristics and inter-sensor differences/biases, 3) and a hybrid sea ice concentration algorithm using the Bristol algorithm over ice and the Bootstrap algorithm in frequency mode over open water. A new algorithm has been developed to estimate the spatially and temporally varying sea ice concentration uncertainties. A comparison to sea ice charts from the Arctic and the Antarctic shows that ice concentrations are higher in the ice charts than estimated from the radiometer data at intermediate ice concentrations. The sea ice climate dataset is available for download at (www.osisaf.org) including documentation.

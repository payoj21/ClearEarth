Plate Tectonics : Pangaea - All Lands 

Pangaea : All Lands 

All of the evidence suggests that 225 million years ago all of the land masses of earth were locked together as a great supercontinent called Pangaea, a Greek word meaning 'all lands'. Panthalessa, Greek for 'all seas', was the name given to the resulting world ocean. Eventually, tectonic forces caused the break-up of Pangaea, leading to the current, albeit temporary, arrangement of oceans, continents, and other land masses. 

Scientists believe that the Earth's crust has been undergoing these transformations for most of it's 4.6 billion year history. Two hundred million years from now a new Pangaea will be formed when all lands again converge. Then, inevitably, another break-up will ensue as our restless planet continues to reform and reshape itself.

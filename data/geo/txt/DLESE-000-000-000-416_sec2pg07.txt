"Can topographic features be used as a guide in earthquake risk assessment?" 

Yes, topographic features can be used as a tool in identifying the risk of active faulting in an area.  When scientists and other professionals are making these sorts of assessments, they tend to concentrate most upon landforms near a potentially active fault trace or on the sub-surface structural geology of an area. Even without specialized training, however, it is possible to formulate some simple hypotheses based on a more generalized look at an area.

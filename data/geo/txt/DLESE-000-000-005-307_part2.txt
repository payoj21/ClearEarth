Continental Drift 

Continental drift was originally proposed by Alfred Wegener, a  German meteorologist, in 1912.  Wegener used the fit of the continents,  the distribution of fossils, a similar sequence of rocks at numerous  locations, ancient climates, and the apparent wandering of the Earth's  polar regions to support his idea.  Wegener used his observations to  hypothesize that all of the present-day continents were once part of a  single supercontinent called Pangaea.

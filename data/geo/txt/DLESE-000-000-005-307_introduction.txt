Introduction to Plate Tectonics 

Plate Tectonics 

Introduction 

Plate tectonics is a relatively new theory that has revolutionized  the way geologists think about the Earth.  According to the theory, the  surface of the Earth is broken into large plates.  The size and position  of these plates change over time.  The edges of these plates, where they  move against each other, are sites of intense geologic activity, such as  earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain building.  Plate tectonics is a  combination of two earlier ideas, continental drift and sea-floor spreading.  Continental drift is the movement  of continents over the  Earth's surface and in their change in position relative to each other.  Sea-floor spreading is the creation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean  ridges and movement of the crust away from the mid-ocean ridges. 

The lesson starts with a description of the chemical and physical  layers of the Earth.  Then the historical development of the plate  tectonic theory is described.  The lesson concludes with descriptions of  the location and types of plate boundaries.  This lesson is longer than most .  A concise classroom presentation might describe the layers of the  Earth, location of plate boundaries, and types of plate motion.

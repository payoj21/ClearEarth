Introduction to Plate Tectonics 

Subduction 

If new oceanic lithosphere is created at mid-ocean ridges, where  does it go?  Geologists had the answer to this question before Vine and  Matthews presented their hypothesis.  In 1935, K. Wadati, a Japanese  seismologist, showed that earthquakes occurred at greater depths towards  the interior of the Asian continent.  Earthquakes beneath the Pacific  Ocean occurred at shallow depths.  Earthquakes beneath Siberia and China  occurred at greater depths.  After World War II, H. Benioff observed the  same distribution of earthquakes but could not offer a plausible explanation. 

The movement of oceanic lithosphere away from mid-ocean ridges  provides an explanation.  Convection cells in the mantle help carry the  lithosphere away from the ridge.  The lithosphere arrives at the edge of  a continent, where it is subducted or sinks into the asthenosphere.   Thus, oceanic lithosphere is created at mid-ocean ridges and consumed at  subduction zones, areas where the lithosphere sinks into the  asthenosphere.  Earthquakes are generated in the rigid plate as it is  subducted into the mantle.  The dip of the plate under the continent  accounts for the distribution of the earthquakes. Magma generated along  the top of the sinking slab rises to the surface to form stratovolcanoes.

Introduction to Plate Tectonics 

Types of Plate Motion 

The ways that plates interact depend on their relative motion and  whether oceanic or continental crust is at the edge of the lithospheric  plate.  Plates move away from, toward, or slide past each other.   Geologists call these divergent, convergent, and transform plate  boundaries. 

At a divergent plate boundary  lithospheric plates move away from each  other.  The mid-Atlantic Ridge, a topographically high area near the  middle of the Atlantic Ocean, is an example of a divergent plate  boundary. 

At a convergent plate boundary, lithospheric plates move toward each  other. The west margin of the South American continent, where the oceanic  Nazca Plate is pushed toward and beneath the continental portion of the  South American Plate, is an example of a convergent plate boundary. 

At a transform plate boundary, plates slide past each other.  The San  Andreas fault in California is an example of a transform plate boundary,  where the Pacific Plate slides past the North American Plate.

Introduction to Plate Tectonics 

Sea-Floor Spreading 

In 1962, a geologist presented an explanation for the global rift  system.  Harry Hess proposed that new ocean floor is formed at the rift  of mid-ocean ridges.  The ocean floor, and the rock beneath it, are  produced by magma that rises from deeper levels.  Hess suggested that the  ocean floor moved laterally away from the ridge and plunged into an  oceanic trench along the continental margin. 

A trench is a steep-walled valley on the sea floor adjacent to a  continental margin.  For example, ocean crust formed at the East Pacific  Rise, an oceanic ridge in the east Pacific, plunges into the trench  adjacent to the Andes Mountains on the west side of the South American  continent.  In Hess' model, convection currents  push the ocean floor  from the mid-ocean ridge to the trench.  The convection currents might  also help move the continents, much like a conveyor belt. 

As Hess formulated his hypothesis, Robert Dietz independently  proposed a similar model and called it sea floor spreading.  Dietz's  model had a significant addition.  It assumed the sliding surface was at  the base of the lithosphere, not at the base of the crust. 

Hess and Dietz succeeded where Wegener had failed.  Continents are  no longer thought to plow through oceanic crust but are considered to be  part of plates that move on the soft, plastic asthenosphere.  A driving  force, convection currents, moved the plates.  Technological advances and  detailed studies of the ocean floor, both unavailable during Wegener's  time, allowed Hess and Dietz to generate the new hypotheses.

Problems with Wegener's Model of Continental Drift 

Wegener's model was not accepted by all geologists.  Some thought  that dispersion by winds or ocean currents could explain the distribution  of fossil species.  Other geologists thought the poles might wander and  continents remain stationary.  Many geologists thought Wegener's evidence  was insufficient. 

The greatest shortcoming, at least in the eyes of American geologists,  was the lack of an adequate mechanism for moving the continents.  Wegener  proposed that the Earth's spin caused the continents to move, plowing  through the oceanic plate and producing mountains on their leading  edges.  Geologists at that time understood enough about the strength of  rocks to know that this was highly unlikely.  Wegener's work was largely  unaccepted in the northern hemisphere.  In the southern hemisphere, where  geologists were familiar with the rocks that Wegener used to support his  hypothesis, continental drift was generally accepted. 

A mechanism to move continents was proposed by Arthur Holmes,  Scottish geologist in 1928.  He believed heat trapped in the Earth caused  convection currents, areas where fluids beneath the Earth's crust rise,  flow laterally, and then fall.  The currents would rise beneath  continents, spread laterally, then plunge beneath the oceans.   (Geologists now know that  solid rock, not fluids, convect in the  mantle).  Unfortunately, Wegener died in 1930 while exploring the  Greenland ice cap.  He never had the opportunity to adapt Holmes' ideas  to his views of continental drift.

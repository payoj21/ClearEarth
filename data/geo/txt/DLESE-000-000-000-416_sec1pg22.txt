Page 22 -- What is an Earthquake? 


Breaking the Crust 

Because tectonic forces are powerful and constant, the rocks subjected to them will tend to break in a way that alleviates the stress they impart to the rocks.  This is accomplished by fracturing and slipping in a manner that accomodates the push or pull of the greatest local stress. 

For example, let's imagine you are in control of a large, square block of the Earth's crust.   If you subject that block to stress by pushing on it from the west edge and the east edge, do you think that a north-south, vertical fracture will be likely to form?  No, because such a break would not accomodate movement from the force you're applying to the block.

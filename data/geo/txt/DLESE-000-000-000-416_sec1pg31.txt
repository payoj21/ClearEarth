Page 31 -- What is an Earthquake? 

"How do all these things relate back to earthquakes?" We originally began this section by looking into the nature of earthquakes.  Answering that question has taken us into a complex discussion of faults and their characteristics.  This, in turn, has brought us to new questions about the characteristics of earthquakes. Is the slip rate of a fault directly related to the rate of earthquakes  along that fault?  If we can make so many distinctions between different faults, can we make similar distinctions between different earthquakes? Could such distinctions give us insight into the timing of earthquakes, and maybe even lead to earthquake prediction?

Shear waves  reach the surface shortly after the P waves and are given the name S or Secondary waves.   S waves travel at about half the speed of P waves.  They move objects in their paths in an up and down motion in the direction that the wave is moving.  S waves can only move through solids and because of this can travel only through the crust and mantle of the Earth.  When S waves strike the outer core, which is made of liquid iron and nickel, the waves stop.
